## Homework 9 Notes:

* Wrote a script that minimizes a function that intentionally has two minima. The script minimizes this function with SciPy's optimize library using two different initial guesses and plots the two outcomes. As expected, the final value obtained by the opitmizer is depedent on the initial value.

* Added a script (*2d_minimum.py*) that find the minimum of a function, in this case a 2D parabola, using different methods. Plots the function and the optimized minimum.
